It's cliche to say that *money doesn't buy happiness*. And while  there are elements of truth in that statement, cliche's have a knack for painting concepts in black and white. The truth is, [having some money][3] does buy happiness, as it reduces the stress of providing basic needs for you and your family. 

But, there's a point whereby acquiring a higher standard of living reaches diminishing returns. At this threshold, wherever it may be for you ($75k USD per year is typical), you would only be marginally more happy with an increase in salary. You don't need steak every night - and as someone who was fortunate enough to experience this personally, after a few months you probably will get sick of living on a beach.

The other night I watched a couple related documentaries, [How To Live Forever][1] and [Transcendent Man][2]. Both were fantastic at reviewing man's recent efforts to attain improved longevity, the second detailing Ray Kurzweil's quest for immortality. Longevity, is different than long life in that it's a long life lived happily and with your health. 

In the end, these documentaries rekindled in me a thought I got pretty hung up with during my first year of university.

Invariably there will be a transition period.
