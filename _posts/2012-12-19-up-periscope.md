In San Francisco, I'm continuously surrounded by doers and it's refreshing. There's a lot of forward momentum, it's infectious, and people learn most effectively by [doing][1]. There's knowing something's right in your head, and there's knowing something's right in your gut - and guts come from experience. So given a choice, focusing on execution is the best way to go.

The fact that you follow through on your plans is valuable, but it's just an ante.  You need to know when to pull your head out of the sand and get your bearings straight, or you'll end up somewhere sub optimal.  So rather than just do, take time to plan and [think][2]. 

It's important to not only begin with the end in mind, not only to choose our ends wisely, and not only to follow through effectively, but to repeat this entire process for goals in every facet of our lives, at a pace matching the scope of each endeavor.

If life is an optimization problem, it's tempting for us to interpret [getting things done][3] with simply execution.  Thinking can feel like we're spinning our wheels, but I think we need to all understand that identifying and defining what needs to get done is just as important.  

Furthermore, it's not enough that we just set goals and set out to complete them - amid execution it's good to come up for air from time to time, and make sure that your key assumptions haven't been invalidated and that you are making timely progress.

In terms of a process, this last point adds "Course Correction" to the Execution step:

1. Goal Identification
2. Goal Definition
3. Planning
4. Execution & Course Correction
5. Success

This additional step is what I call Up Periscope, and it can be frustrating for doers, because in addition to making us feel like we're spinning our wheels, it calls our current progress into question.

Maybe, and you may not have even learned anything useful from the exercise. But the time to recognize that is now, before more time is wasted running in the wrong direction.

Everything planned is based on a hypothesis, everything done is an experiment. Periodically evaluate your progress in each part of your life, adjust course as necessary, and don't be afraid to move on to the next trial when your current one has run it's course.
